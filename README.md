Requirements: For this project to work, you need to do the follow steps (we'll probably be too lazy to make an exe to do it for you).

1: Have python and an IDE installed.

2: Pip install pyTesseract and OpenCV with vsc or command prompt.

3: Install Tesseract (avaliable on their github).

4: Set an environmental variable to the tesseract.exe file in windows.

5: Enter the image you want to scan into the folder you cloned the repo into.

6: ???

7: Profit.
