# PhotoMid
This project is a primtive version of photomath, written in python using OpenCV and pyTesseract. It can solve systems of linear equations in some cases. For it to work the image has to be of a system of equations on the form 2x+3y+5z=9. We might add a function for it to solve matrix multiplications and projection later, but uncertain for now.

Requirements: For this project to work, you need to do the follow steps (we'll probably be too lazy to make an exe to do it for you).

1: Have python and an IDE installed.

2: Pip install pyTesseract and OpenCV with vsc or command prompt.

3: Install Tesseract (avaliable on their github).

4: Set an environmental variable to the tesseract.exe file in windows.

5: Run GUI file

5: Enter the image you want to scan into the folder you cloned the repo into.

6: ???

7: Profit.


Keep in mind that the pictures uploaded to the program have to be in VERY clear handwriting as tesseract is suprisingly crap at its job. We might provide a test picture that it can actually solve.
